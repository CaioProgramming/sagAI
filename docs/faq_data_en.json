          "answer": "Each genre in SagAI has a unique and strictly enforced art style to create a cohesive visual experience. Fantasy stories are rendered in a classic Oil Painting style, Punk tales have a gritty Cartoon/Gorillaz-inspired look, and Shinobi adventures are visualized with traditional Ink Wash aesthetics."
