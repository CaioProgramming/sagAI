Date: 2025-09-02 11:23

Purpose: A user-experience oriented roadmap of potential features. Each item is phrased as a user-visible outcome and includes a brief hint for acceptance. Check off when delivered.

## Onboarding & First-Time Experience
1. [ ] Gentle first-run tour explaining "What is a Saga?" with 3–5 swipeable cards. (Tour appears once; skippable; viewable later from Settings.)
2. [ ] Quick-start template picker (e.g., Fantasy, Romance, Sci‑Fi, Mystery) with illustrative cover art. (Selecting a template pre-fills genre and tone.)
3. [ ] Example saga loaded on first run to showcase features. (Read-only sample accessible from Home.)

## Creation Flow & Guidance
4. [ ] Goal-based wizard for new saga (e.g., “Short series”, “Epic trilogy”). (Wizard reduces mandatory inputs; progress indicator.)
5. [ ] Tone sliders (Light–Dark, Serious–Playful) to influence prompts. (Live preview of blurb updates as sliders move.)
6. [ ] Character builder with portraits and traits. (Auto-suggest names; can randomize; save to character list.)
7. [ ] Worldbuilding cards (locations, factions, lore seeds) with AI expansions. (Tap to expand any card.)
8. [ ] Creative constraints (e.g., no violence, kid-friendly). (Visible badges on saga; enforced in generation prompts.)
9. [ ] Inline guidance tips (“Try adding a conflict to deepen tension”). (Dismissible; can be toggled in Settings.)

## Writing & Editing Experience
10. [ ] Rich text editor with styles (headers, italics, quotes) and word count. (Compose-friendly; supports dark mode.)
11. [ ] AI rewrite suggestions (shorter/longer, more vivid, simpler). (Preview diff and accept/reject per suggestion.)
12. [ ] Version history with named snapshots. (Restore previous version; timestamped.)
13. [ ] Distraction-free reading/writing mode. (Full-screen; adjustable margin and font size.)
14. [ ] Chapter/Act outline view with drag-and-drop reordering. (Auto-updates numbering.)
15. [ ] Smart continuity checker (flags name/tone inconsistencies). (Non-blocking; shows suggestions.)

## Visuals & Media
16. [ ] Cover generator with multiple style options (watercolor, comic, oil). (User selects favorite from 4+ candidates.)
17. [ ] Scene illustrations per chapter (optional). (Thumbnail gallery view within chapter.)
18. [ ] Ambient soundtrack recommendations for reading. (Spotify/YouTube links; toggle in Settings.)

## Personalization & Recommendations
19. [ ] Home screen dynamic call-to-action cards based on reading/creation habits. (Rotates daily; not repetitive.)
20. [ ] Personalized prompt seeds based on favorite genres and tones. (Edit preferences in Profile.)
21. [ ] Daily writing streaks with gentle reminders. (Streak counter; configurable reminder time.)

## Social, Sharing & Collaboration
22. [ ] Shareable saga preview pages (cover, blurb, first chapter). (Public link; privacy controlled per saga.)
23. [ ] Collaborator mode: invite a friend to co-create. (Live presence indicator; change suggestions.)
24. [ ] Commenting and reactions on chapters (private or shared lists). (Per-paragraph comments; resolve thread.)
25. [ ] Export to ePub/PDF with cover and TOC. (Selectable trim sizes; preserves styles.)

## Retention & Notifications
26. [ ] Smart reminders based on inactivity and goals. (Respect Do Not Disturb; weekly digest option.)
27. [ ] Release notes inside the app highlighting new UX features. (One-tap “What’s new”.)
28. [ ] Milestone celebrations (first saga, 10k words). (Confetti animation; toggleable.)

## Accessibility & Internationalization
29. [ ] Full dynamic type support and high-contrast theme. (Meets WCAG AA for text contrast.)
30. [ ] Voice input for scenes and commands. (Works offline when possible; simple controls.)
31. [ ] Multilingual UI and prompt localization (starting with EN, PT‑BR, ES). (Language switch in Settings.)

## Trust, Safety & Controls
32. [ ] Content sensitivity filter with user-set thresholds. (Explains impact; can override per saga.)
33. [ ] Source attribution/log for AI suggestions ("why this change"). (Viewable in suggestion details.)
34. [ ] Offline mode for reading and drafting. (Syncs changes when back online.)

## Discovery & Library
35. [ ] Smart library filters (genre, progress, last updated). (Persistent across sessions.)
36. [ ] Continue where you left off card on Home. (Deep links to last edited chapter.)
37. [ ] Collections: group sagas into playlists (e.g., “NaNoWriMo”). (Custom cover and description.)

## Monetization (Optional/Future)
38. [ ] Premium theme packs and illustration styles. (Preview before purchase.)

40. [ ] Tip jar for creators when sharing public previews. (Uses platform-native purchase flow.)
