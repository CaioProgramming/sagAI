# sagAI — AI-powered Saga and Chat RPG Creator

sagAI is an Android app that helps you create, expand, and play through interactive sagas using generative AI. The objective of the project is to make long-form storytelling approachable and fun: pick a genre, set the tone, and let AI co-author chapters, scenes, and worldbuilding elements while you stay in control of the plot.

## Project Objective
- Empower creators to prototype and write sagas (series, novels, episodic adventures) with AI assistance.
- Provide guidance and structure (genres, tones, constraints) without sacrificing creative freedom.
- Offer an enjoyable reading/writing flow with iterative AI suggestions and continuity across chapters.

## What you can do
- Create a new saga by choosing a genre and a high-level premise.
- Generate blurbs, outlines, and scenes; iterate with AI to refine tone and detail.
- Keep continuity with characters, locations, and lore as your story grows.
