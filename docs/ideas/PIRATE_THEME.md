# PIRATE Theme Concept

## Overview
The PIRATE theme captures the Golden Age of Piracy (1650s-1730s) - a world of high-seas adventure, treasure hunts, naval battles, Caribbean islands, and the freedom (and danger) of life beyond civilization's reach. This theme balances swashbuckling action with the gritty reality of maritime outlaws, creating a universe of rum-soaked taverns, weathered maps, cursed gold, and the eternal struggle between fortune and fate.

## Art Style

### Technique
**Weathered Maritime Oil Painting / Vintage Nautical Illustration**

- **Medium**: Oil on canvas with visible aging - cracks, water stains, salt-weathered texture
- **Line Work**: Bold ink outlines reminiscent of old maritime charts and ship's log illustrations
- **Texture**: Canvas weave, rope fiber texture, weathered wood grain, sea spray effects
- **Aesthetic Era**: Golden Age of Piracy (1650-1730) meets Victorian maritime exploration art
- **Reference Artists**: J.M.W. Turner (seascapes), N.C. Wyeth (adventure illustrations), Howard Pyle (pirate illustrations)

### Key Visual Elements
- **Lighting**: Warm golden hour (sunset/sunrise over ocean), lantern glow, moonlight on water
- **Atmosphere**: Salt spray, sea mist, heat haze over tropical waters, storm clouds gathering
- **Materiality**: Weathered wood, tarnished brass, sun-bleached canvas sails, rope and rigging
- **Details**: Nautical instruments (compass, sextant, spyglass), treasure maps, rum bottles, cutlasses

### Color & Accent Application
- **Base Palette**: Weathered wood browns, ocean blues, sun-bleached canvas whites, tropical greens
- **Mandatory Accent**: SUNSET GOLD / CARIBBEAN TEAL
- **Application**: Use gold for treasure glints, lantern light, sunset reflections on water, brass fittings. Use teal for ocean depths, tropical waters, mysterious glows. The rest should feel sun-bleached and salt-weathered.
- **Forbid**: Overly vibrant modern colors, clean pristine surfaces, digital smoothness

### Mood
Epic yet gritty, adventurous yet dangerous. A sense of freedom and lawlessness, the romance of the open sea balanced with the harsh reality of pirate life. Evoke both the thrill of discovery and the constant threat of betrayal, storms, and the gallows.

### Ambience
- Wide ocean horizons with distant islands
- Creaking ship timbers and snapping sails
- Tropical heat or storm-driven rain
- Bioluminescent plankton at night
- Distant cannon fire and seabird cries
- The smell of salt, tar, and rum

## Cinematography & Composition

### Framing Emphasis
- **Wide Shots**: Emphasize the vastness of the ocean, isolation of ships, scale of naval battles
- **Dutch Angles**: Tilted frames to suggest ship movement, instability, chaos
- **Low Angles**: Make ships and captains appear imposing and powerful
- **Deck-Level Shots**: Show characters at work - rigging, navigation, combat
- **Horizon Line**: Always visible to ground the maritime setting

### Composition Notes
- Use rope rigging, masts, and ship architecture to create natural framing
- Emphasize the contrast between cramped ship quarters and vast ocean
- Show weather as a character - storms, fog, calm seas
- Include nautical details: maps being studied, treasure being counted, weapons being maintained
- Capture the camaraderie and tension of crew life

---

## Conversation Style (Narrative & NPCs)

### Language & Vocabulary
- **Terminology**: Nautical terms (port, starboard, bow, stern, fathoms, leagues, knots), pirate slang ("ahoy", "avast", "belay", "scuttle", "landlubber", "bilge rat"), maritime concepts (mutiny, marooning, articles, letters of marque)
- **Formality**: Ranges from rough sailor's cant to educated captain's speech. Officers may be more formal, crew more crude
- **Idioms**: Sea-based metaphors ("dead in the water", "three sheets to the wind", "loose cannon", "know the ropes")
- **Profanity**: Moderate use of period-appropriate curses and oaths ("Blast!", "Damn your eyes!", "By thunder!"). Avoid modern profanity

### Tone & Delivery
- **Adventurous & Bold**: Characters speak with confidence, bravado, and a sense of freedom
- **Superstitious**: References to sea legends, curses, omens, and maritime folklore
- **Mercenary**: Focus on treasure, profit, shares of plunder, and survival
- **Camaraderie & Betrayal**: Crew bonds balanced with constant threat of mutiny
- **Pacing**: Can be leisurely during calm seas, urgent during storms or battles

### Narrative Voice
- Descriptions should evoke the sensory experience of sea life: salt spray, creaking timbers, endless horizons
- Maintain a sense of adventure and danger - the sea is both beautiful and deadly
- Include maritime details: ship conditions, weather patterns, navigation challenges
- Reference the pirate code, ship hierarchy, and the tension between freedom and survival

## Naming Conventions

### Character Names
Aim for names that evoke the Golden Age of Piracy, blending historical authenticity with colorful nicknames.

**Influences**:
- Historical pirate names (Blackbeard, Calico Jack, Anne Bonny, Mary Read)
- Maritime nicknames based on appearance, origin, or deeds ("Red", "Ironhand", "The Spaniard")
- Biblical and classical names common in the era (Ezekiel, Tobias, Jeremiah, Hector)
- Nautical terms as surnames (Tidewater, Stormcrow, Saltwind)
- Geographic origins (Bristol, Cornwall, Nassau, Tortuga)

**Examples**:
- Captains: Captain Elias Blackwood, Commodore James Redbeard, Captain Isabella "Bella" Stormheart
- Crew: "One-Eye" Jack, Thomas Saltwind, Mary "Cutlass" Morgan, Rodrigo the Navigator
- Antagonists: Admiral Thornton, Governor Ashford, Captain "Iron" Drake

**Guidelines**:
- First names: Period-appropriate (English, Spanish, French, Dutch common in Caribbean)
- Nicknames: Descriptive, earned through deeds or appearance
- Avoid: Modern names, fantasy elements, overly dramatic titles
- Consider: Names common in the current app language, adapted to the pirate era
