# AI Message Tone Update - January 9, 2026

## Overview

Updated all AI messages across saga and character creation to be more casual, natural, and genuinely
humorous—like a friend texting, not a professional assistant.

## Key Tone Shift

### Before:

- Professional and warm: "A playful, encouraging greeting that makes the user excited"
- Polite and structured: "Keep the tone warm, humorous, and encouraging"
- Corporate-friendly: "Welcome to character creation!"

### After:

- Casual and real: "Like texting a friend who's good at storytelling"
- Naturally humorous: "Add humor or light sarcasm when it fits—don't force it"
- No corporate speak: "Think 'Alright, let's make something cool' vibes, not 'Welcome to our
  platform!' vibes"

## Specific Changes

- Playful irony: "friend who's seen too many movies and has opinions"
- Self-aware: "friend who's played too much D&D"

- "So what's this thing actually about?"
- NOT "Could you please elaborate on the narrative concept?"
